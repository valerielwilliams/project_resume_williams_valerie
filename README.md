# Resources
I used the following resources for this assignment:

* The [HTML5 Doctor](http://html5doctor.com/the-address-element/) helped me decide whether or not to use the Address tag.(I did because that is my contact information. I regret nothing.)
* The [W3C Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_punctuation.asp) set me straight on how to enter an em dash without upsetting the HTML5 validator. 
* I found this awesome plugin called [Gradientify](https://github.com/codefog/jquery-gradientify) that adds gradient transitions to websites. I really like the effect it gave to the background of my resume.
* [Paletton.com](http://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF) helped me find tasteful colors to use for my gradient transitions. 

# Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

#Comments
I really wanted to link to some of the training videos that I have stored on YouTube, but I could not get the lightbox plugin to work at all. Sadness.
